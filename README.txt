__Things to do for now__

	+Add full network functionality
	+Use variables for sizes, filenames, etc. DO NOT HARDCODE THEM!
	+Rename GraphicsEngine class to something else since it does more that drawing (or redesign)
	
__MAJOR_REDESIGN__

	+Changed the main loop logic to another one clearer to read
	+For that reason the prototypes of many functions have been changed
	+Changes include new Game methods and modification to some Boards methods as well
